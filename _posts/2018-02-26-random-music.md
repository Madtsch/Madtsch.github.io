Someone told me, that someone else made some money with his own music on Spotify. He bought some accounts - more then 1.000 and played his own songs 24 hours.

This songs has to be longer than 30 seconds. So my new song, made with Sequel 3 from Steinbeg in just 10 minutes is 40 seconds long.

So - whom I have to give my bank account numbers to get some money?

Do you wanna <a href="http://blogold.markus-doetsch.de/?attachment_id=2637">hear my song?</a> It's your risk - I warned you - somehow!
