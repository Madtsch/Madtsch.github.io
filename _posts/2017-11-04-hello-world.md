This is my first blog entry in this new blog format. I don't use a dynamic framework anymore. It is now done with a static site generator.

If you want to know more, take a look at the slides of my DOAG 2017 speach.

The second change in my blog is about the language. It is not german any more, mostly. All old content is still german, but all new things will be in english. Will you still follow me as before? I am sure, you will!

Why is that? So - I don't know - perhaps, because I can!
