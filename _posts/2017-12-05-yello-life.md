The members of cult band Yello are 65 and 72. They start to left their mark on the music business at the end of the 70!

Now, they playing a concert - life concert - with real musicians in Olympia Halle in Munich. They done this never before. And I was there. The card was in my pocket - since a year ago. And it was not cheap.

So - whats the result? It was cool - but Yello is no a life band. Never was! But Mr. Boris Blank knows how to handle a computer. He demonstrate what is possible today.

And Mr. Dieter Meier knows to handle his voice. And together they are Yello. Since 37 years they know how to rush, push and cash.
