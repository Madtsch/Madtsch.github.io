Yesterday, I got a message. Are you flexible, was the question. Yes I am flexible! [Herbie Hancock][1] is in town.

One of the heroes of the early eighties. First I thought I knew him from "numma, numma, numma, nineteen", but no - this was Paul Hardcastle. Mr. Hancock, now a legend in Jazz, brought me in my youth songs like "Rockit". You know this song - I am sure! :)

A quick research on Spotify got me some more information about his work. And if you like Jazz, you know some of his songs.

So - a few hours later I am sitting in the concert hall of Gasteig in Munich. And with me Herbie. What then happened was not expected from me.

Four guys, Herbie on Keyboard and Piano, a Bass Guitar hero, some Drummer guru and and a man with Keyboard and Saxophon start to play music. But then, it started to become interresting.

After a minute with synthysizer sounds like in space, they played Free Jazz (I think).

Free - like - everybody can play what he wants - and magical - it sounds not soooo bad. I like the variations in Jazz. But this was very free in variations.

After the first set, let's say after 20 minutes, Herbie grabs a microfone and start talking. He says, "the munich audience is fantastic"! First i thought - this is the guy saying everywhere. But then I understand. Some people of the audience was leaving the building. Not everyone like so much freedom. :)

And he was happy, that most of the munich audience stayed, until the end.

On the next day, I saw this tour was under the motto ["Spacey und weird"][2]. And yes, it was spacey - and sometimes it was weird. But it was possible to get used to it - even to like it.

And so - we stayed also, until the end.

Should he come back in town someday - its possible to concider another concert with Herbie Hancock.
