I jumped a little around in Spotify. From one song to another. And suddenly I came to a playlist - made from Spotify itself.

For a guy - so old as I am - this is real time jump! Some titles are in my saved playlists, but some I totally forgot. I had the feeling I didn't here this songs the last decades.

Another part of the songs are totally new for me. But they are from the same age. What does this mean? Was it possible, that we were not right informed in the old days? Is it nowadays easier to be informed? Was has this for consequences to the hole life, personal, political and seen on the entire life?

So many questions. And now answer - not today! :)
